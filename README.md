Mute All for League of Legends

I was angry with people who have a bad-mouth
It was very tiresome that I input "/mute all" everytime entering a game
So I make this.

This function is very simple
1. A smile icon will appear on your tray bard after executing mutelol.exe
2. It will input "/mute all" automatically when you enter game
