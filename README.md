# Auto Mute All for the game "League of Legends"

I was angry with some people who are foul-mouthed

It was very tiresome that I input "/mute all" everytime entering a game

So I made this.

### You can download this program : https://github.com/ijij6960/mutelol/raw/master/exe/MuteLoL.exe
#

This program is very simple

1. A smile icon will appear on your tray bar after executing mutelol.exe

2. It will input "/mute all" automatically when you enter game
